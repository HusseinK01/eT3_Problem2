For this problem the following steps were taken:

1. iterated over the lines in the text file
2. split them on white spaces
3. created a json object for each line, filling each attribute with its corresponding value
4. add that json object to a list of objects
5. wrote the list into a new json file, indenting for nice formatting

On how to run: simply run problem2.py and the json file will be generated
